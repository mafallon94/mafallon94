Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Fallon (@mafallon94), a 28 year old currently finishing a Computer Science MSc conversion at the University of Birmingham, with the aim of pursuing a career in software development/software engineering following the degree. 

I am a capable programmer, with a keen understanding of back end programming with Java, database programming with SQL, and front end programming with Java FX.

My Git-hub repositories document all the projects I have completed so far, mostly in Java programming. There is:
- A limited implemention of a Bingo Card game (Java)
- A text based exploration game, in which the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be filled with wealth (Java)
- A Student Marks Capturing System with GUI (Java & Java FX)
- An SQL program which creates, populates, and queries a database (PostgreSQL)
- A Database Client-Server program which queries a database for Album Titles (Java & SQL)

I hope that the projects are of interest! If you would to contact me about anything, my email is fallonmatt93@gmail.com.
